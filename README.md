## 💥 The history of fridaynight

Who has never been frustrated with applications related to card games?
I always wanted an application that would allow me to create a championship among my friends, help me organize all the tables and rounds.
And this is why I decided to create this app. The project was created to organize meetings and championships between friends to play card games.
